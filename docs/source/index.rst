Welcome to SVUnit's documentation!
==================================

SVUnit is a simple, well-structured verification framework intended for design and verification engineers writing and running tests against Verilog modules, classes or interfaces. By first verifying the individual pieces of a design or testbench in isolation, we can assume much higher quality of the design or testbench as a whole.
The feature characteristic of SVUnit is ease-of-use, meaning developers can be up-and-running in an hour or less. SVUnit is open-source under Apache 2.0 licensing making it accessible and productive for any engineer with a Verilog simulator.
